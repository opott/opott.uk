# Education

I'm currently completing my secondary education, with predicted grade 8s in Science, Computer Science, English & Photography, and grade 6 in Maths.

<div class="about" style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 2rem;">

        <h2>The Brilliant Club</h2>
        <p>
            In 2024 I completed an additional course titled “Can Viruses Make Us Feel Better? Bacteriophages vs Antibiotics”, led by PhD tutor Dr Sammy Kay as part of The Brilliant Club’s Scholars Programme. I attended 7 university-style ‘tutorials’, exploring the importance of diagnosis (1), antimicrobial resistance (2), bacteriophages (3), public opinion (4) and academic writing (5). Each tutorial had corresponding homework. Following tutorial 5, I was tasked with producing a 500-word draft essay in the form of a letter. After feedback on the draft (tutorial 6), I completed a 2000-word final essay, which consisted of an introduction, background, biology, advantages & disadvantages of bacteriophages, public opinion and a conclusion. This essay also had to include Harvard-style references to sources used. I then attended a one-to-one feedback session with Dr Kay, in which I received a 2:1 grade for my essay. I then attended a graduation event along with students from across the country at the University of Nottingham.

# Work Experience

        <h2>Hack Club</h2>
        <h3>August 2024 - Present</h3>
        <p>
            I have worked in various voluntary positions within the Hack Club community. My volunteer work started during their Summer 2024 event (Arcade), where I was taken on during the final weeks of the event to get through the session review backlog. Following this, I was invited to assist on the support team for their Winter 2024 event (High Seas), where I assisted teenagers with their queries throughout the event. During the event, I was taken on by the fraud team as a fraud investigator. I am still standing on this team and currently assisting with the current Summer 2025 event (Summer of Making).

        <h3>July 2025</h3>
        <p>
            During my one week placement at MML, I worked alongside a Service Desk Analyst and Service Desk Manager. During this time, the company was in the process of rolling out Windows 11 across all of their machines - I assisted with this deployment by locating PCs and laptops around the depot which were not fully up to date, and going to begin the update process to ensure a smooth experience for the customers. I was also assigned a task to set up an IT service kiosk, which is designed to reduce the number of walk-ins to the IT office and allow customers to raise a ticket from tablets located around the depot. This week was extremely insightful into the roles and responsibilities of working on the IT helpdesk!
